       <h2>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀The black and white “tuxedo” look donned by most penguin species is a clever camouflage called countershading. </h2> 
       <h2>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Penguins evolved to fly underwater.   </h2>
       <h2>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Penguins live in many locations and habitats.    </h2>
       <h2>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀All birds have knees, but not all birds have kneecaps. Penguins happen to have both, although their kneecaps (patellae) have a very different shape from ours.    </h2>
       <h2>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Penguin kneecaps are not flattened like our own but rather more cube-shaped. These bones are situated within a tendon and assist when flexing the knee joint.    </h2>
       <h2>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Large penguin populations can be found in countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Chile, Argentina and South Africa.    </h2>
       <h2>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀No penguins live at the North Pole.    </h2>
       <h2>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Penguins can drink sea water.    </h2>
       <h2>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀From the outside, Penguin’s legs look remarkably short and stubby. Dense feathers hide most of their legs    </h2>
